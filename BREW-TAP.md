# Homebrew Custom Tap — Requirements (termv)

This document outlines the requirements and steps to distribute **termv** (Terminal Velocity) via a Homebrew **custom tap**.

---

## 1. Naming Conventions

### Tap Repository
- Repo name **must** be:  
homebrew-tap

- GitHub location example:
github.com/rjchicago/homebrew-tap


### Formula Name
- Formula filename:
Formula/termv.rb

- Class name **must match** (PascalCase):
```ruby
class Termv < Formula
2. termv Project Requirements
The termv source repository must include:

termv/
 ├ Makefile
 ├ README.md
 ├ LICENSE
 └ termv        # final executable (or generated by make)
Build Expectations
make produces a runnable executable named termv

OR a clearly defined build target (e.g. make build)

No interactive prompts during build

Build must work on:

macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon)

3. Makefile Expectations
Recommended Makefile behavior:

make
# produces ./termv
Optional (nice-to-have):

make install PREFIX=/usr/local
Homebrew will usually handle installation via bin.install, not make install.

4. Homebrew Formula Requirements
Minimum required fields in termv.rb:

class Termv < Formula
  desc "Terminal Velocity — fast terminal-based tool"
  homepage "https://github.com/rjchicago/termv"
  url "https://github.com/rjchicago/termv/archive/refs/tags/v1.0.0.tar.gz"
  sha256 "<SHA256>"
  license "MIT"

  def install
    system "make"
    bin.install "termv"
  end
end
Notes
Formula installs from a tagged release, not main

bin.install places termv into:

$(brew --prefix)/bin
5. Release Requirements
Homebrew requires versioned source archives.

Tagging a Release
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
SHA256
shasum -a 256 v1.0.0.tar.gz
Update the formula with the resulting hash.

6. Tap Usage
Add Tap
brew tap rjchicago/tap
Install termv
brew install termv
Upgrade
brew upgrade termv
7. Local Testing (Before Publishing)
brew install --build-from-source ./Formula/termv.rb
To uninstall:

brew uninstall termv
8. Versioning & Updates
Every new version requires:

New Git tag

Updated url

Updated sha256

Formula must be committed to the tap repo

9. Recommended Tap Layout (Future-Proof)
homebrew-tap/
 └ Formula/
    ├ termv.rb
    ├ overtone.rb
    ├ takt.rb
    ├ octave8ctl.rb
10. Best Practices
Keep formula logic minimal

No network access during build

No writes outside build directory

Use bin.install, not manual cp

Summary
Custom tap provides:

Fast iteration

Full ownership

No Homebrew Core approval process

Best install path:

brew install rjchicago/tap/termv
